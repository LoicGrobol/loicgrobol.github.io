I am a *ma√Ætre de conf√©rence* (‚âà Assistant Professor) in computational linguistics at [Universit√©
Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France üá´üá∑, in the [MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) lab.

My name is pronounced like this: [loic g Åob…îl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and
gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where they exist.

## My research

My research interests focus on machine learning applications to natural language processing, and
specifically to irregular and low-resource contexts, including diachronic and historical data and
low-resource languages.

More specifically, these days I work on:

- Automatic syntactic parsing of historical languages
- Resource construction and bootstrapping for low-resource languages

Most of my work ‚Äî‚ÄØin writing and in code‚ÄØ‚Äî is available on [Github](https://github.com/loicgrobol)
and [my page](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/lgrobol) on the GitLab instance of [the HumaNum
consortium](http://huma-num.fr). I always welcome collaborations, bug reports and contributions.
You can also find a list of my published works in
[HAL](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/loic-grobol).

If you have questions or would like to request more information about any of the projects I am
working on or the resources behind them, feel free to reach out at
