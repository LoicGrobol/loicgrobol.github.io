Hi! Bonjour‚ÄØ! Hej! Demat‚ÄØ!
=========================

I'm Lo√Øc Grobol. I'm a *ma√Ætre de conf√©rence* (‚âà Assistant Professor) in computational linguistics
at [Universit√© Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France üá´üá∑, in the
[MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) team and associate member of the [Lattice](lattice.cnrs.fr) lab
([CNRS](https://cnrs.fr) and [√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu)).

I pronounce my name [loic g Åob…îl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and gender-neutral
pronouns in other languages where they exist.

## My research

My research interests focus on machine learning applications to natural language processing, and
specifically to low-resource contexts such as minority and low-resource languages or diachronic and
historical data. More specifically, these days I'm focusing on resource building, machine
translation and syntactic parsing. My first priority is to develop tools and resources that would
actually be helpful for linguistic communities.

Most of my work ‚Äî‚ÄØin writing and in code‚ÄØ‚Äî is available on [Github](https://github.com/loicgrobol)
and the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/lgrobol) instance of the HumaNum consortium. I always
welcome bug reports and contributions.

Feel free to reach out at [lgrobol@parisnanterre.fr](mailto:lgrobol@parisnanterre.fr) for questions,
chats and impromptu jam sessions.
