Hi! Bo√±jour deoc'h‚ÄØ! Hej!
========================

I'm Lo√Øc Grobol [loic g Åob…îl], MCF (‚âà Associate Professor) in computational linguistics at
[Universit√© Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France üá´üá∑, in the
[MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) team and associate member of the [Lattice](lattice.cnrs.fr) lab
([CNRS](https://cnrs.fr) and [√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu)).

My first name can also be written Loig and I also use Morgan, especially out of professional
situations. My pronouns are they/them in English, gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where
they exist and any pronouns where they don't.

## My research

My research interests focus on machine learning applications to natural language processing, and
specifically to low-resource contexts such as minority and low-resource languages or diachronic and
historical data. More specifically, these days I'm focusing on resource building, machine
translation and syntactic parsing. My first priority is to develop tools and resources that would
actually be helpful for linguistic communities.

Most of my work ‚Äî‚ÄØin writing and in code‚ÄØ‚Äî is available on [Github](https://github.com/loicgrobol)
and the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/lgrobol) instance of the HumaNum consortium. I always
welcome bug reports and contributions.

Feel free to reach out at [loic.grobol@gmail.com](mailto:loic.grobol@gmail.com) for questions,
chats and impromptu jam sessions.
