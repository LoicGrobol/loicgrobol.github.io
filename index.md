**Loïc** Grobol
===============

I am a *maître de conférence* (≈ Assistant Professor) in computational linguistics at [Université
Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France 🇫🇷, in the [MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) lab.

My name is pronounced like this: [loic gʁobɔl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and
gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where they exist.

My research interests focus on machine learning applications to natural language processing; and
specifically to irregular and low-resource contexts, including diachronic and historical data and
low-resource languages.

More specifically, these days I work on:

- Automatic syntactic parsing of low-resource languages
- Human-centric and interpretable evaluation of NLP systems.

Most of my work — in writing and in code — is available on [Github](https://github.com/loicgrobol)
and [my page](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/lgrobol) on the GitLab instance of [the HumaNum
consortium<](http://huma-num.fr). I always welcome collaborations, bug reports and contributions.
You can also find a list of my published works in
[HAL](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/loic-grobol).

If you have any questions or would like to request more information about any of the projects I am
working on or the resources behind them, feel free to reach me at [loic.grobol@gmail.com](mailto:loic.grobol@gmail.com).
