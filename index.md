I'm Lo√Øc Grobol. I am a *ma√Ætre de conf√©rence* (‚âà Assistant Professor) in computational linguistics
at [Universit√© Paris Nanterre](https://parisnanterre.fr), France üá´üá∑, in the
[MoDyCo](https://modyco.fr) team.

I pronounce my name [loic g Åob…îl]. I typically use they/them pronouns in English and
gender-neutral pronouns in other languages where they exist.

## My research

My research interests focus on machine learning applications to natural language processing, and
specifically to irregular and low-resource contexts, including diachronic and historical data and
low-resource languages. More specifically, these days I work on automatic syntactic parsing of
historical languages and resource building and bootstrapping for low-resource languages.

Most of my work ‚Äî‚ÄØin writing and in code‚ÄØ‚Äî is available on [Github](https://github.com/loicgrobol)
and the [Gitlab](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/lgrobol) instance of the HumaNum consortium. I always
welcome bug reports and contributions.

Feel free to reach out at [lgrobol@parisnanterre.fr](mailto:lgrobol@parisnanterre.fr) for questions,
chats and impromptu jam sessions.
